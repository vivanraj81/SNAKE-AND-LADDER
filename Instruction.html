            <h2>1. Players take turns in clockwise order.<br>
                2. On your turn, roll a six-sided die (or spin a spinner with the numbers 1 to 6) to determine how many squares you will move your game piece.<br>
                3. Move your game piece forward the number of squares indicated by the die roll. For example, if you roll a 4, move your piece four squares ahead.<br>
                4. If your game piece lands on a square with the base of a ladder, you can climb up the ladder, which will take you to the square at the top of the ladder. This is an advantage.<br>
                5. If your game piece lands on a square with the head of a snake, you must slide down the snake to the square at its tail. This is a setback.<br>
                6. Continue taking turns and moving your game piece until you reach the final square (100) or exceed it.<br>
                7. The first player to reach or exceed the final square wins the game.</h2>
